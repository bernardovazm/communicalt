# Communicalt - Web Platform and Software to provide alternative communication

This was a Technological Innovation Project made in 2018 with a Web Platform and App, presented at FINIT BH on that year.

# Context of the project
We are a group of students who seek to help professionals, institutions, responsibles and parents who are in contact with people that cannot communicate. That's why we created our alternative communication software. 

We have developed alternative communication clipboard creation software and a platform to store student information, which helps professionals specialized in this area.

The software allows the creation of clipboards and the use of auditory resources implemented in the symbols to keep the attention of users in an AEE (Specialized Educational Service) institutions.
